#### Python: Handling newline `\n` in raw string
[<u>24 Jan 2023</u>] Python: Handling newline `\n` in text or 'plain' raw string  
This code is for my [short article in Medium](https://medium.com/@AKayode_research/python-handling-newline-n-in-text-or-plain-raw-string-cde50113cf3e), outlining how to handle newline `\n` pattern in text by leveraging the regex flag `re.DOTALL` within Python.

#### Python: Preference handling in multiple base class inheritance | *__mro__*
[<u>26 Dec 2022</u>] How is preference approached in selecting methods from multiple classes when inherited in **Python**?  
This code is for my [short article in Medium](https://medium.com/@AKayode_research/python-preference-handling-in-multiple-base-class-inheritance-d96f269efd55), which explores the order of preference (level linearisation) that is followed in Python.  
Unlike in (some) other languages like Java, AFAIK, Python allows inheriting more than one base class.
